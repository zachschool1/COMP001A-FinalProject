                        <h2> Introduction</h2>
                        <p> Nearly 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese. Overweight and Obesity are associated with a number of chornic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Even modest weight loss, described as 5% decrease in body weight, has been shown to lower the risk of chronic disease. Many people are turning to Plant-Based Diets (PBDs) for weight loss. </p>
                        <p> PBDs, including vegan and vegetarian diets, are based around fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes, with vegetarian diets also typically including dairy products and eggs.  </p>
